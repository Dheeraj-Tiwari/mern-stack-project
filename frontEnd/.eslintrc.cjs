// The provided code is an ESLint configuration file in CommonJS format. It extends the 'airbnb' style guide and includes plugins for React and React Hooks.

// Here's an explanation of the key components:

// env: Specifies the environment where the code will run, such as the browser and ECMAScript 2021 (ES12).
// extends: Extends the 'airbnb' style guide and enables the use of recommended rules for React.
// overrides: Allows you to define additional rules or configurations for specific files or directories.
// parserOptions: Specifies the parser options, such as the ECMAScript version and source type.
// plugins: Includes the 'react' and 'react-hooks' plugins for additional linting rules related to React and React Hooks.
// rules: Specifies the ESLint rules and their configurations. For example, 'react-hooks/rules-of-hooks' enforces rules of Hooks, 'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps' checks effect dependencies, 'disable-next-line' allows the use of disable-next-line comments, and 'no-console' allows the use of console statements.
// Overall, this ESLint configuration enforces best practices and guidelines for React development and includes rules related to React Hooks and console usage.
